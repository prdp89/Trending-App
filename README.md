        2. DI - This package contains Dagger v2.0 Modules and Components used to provide dependency at runtime.
	
        3. Repository - This layer provides an interface between ViewModel and DataSource.
	
        4. View/ViewModel - This layer provides interaction between View and ViewModel using Data Binding approach.

		1. Android Lifecycle: Android lifecycle components such as RoomDB and lifecycle extensions
	
		2. Glide: Use to load images inside Recycler View
	
		3. Retrofit and Moshi: Use to make rest Api call and Parse Json to Model
